# Binary Search Gang
An open-source project designed to get you a job.
## What is the Binary Search Gang?
The Binary Search Gang is a group of students at UTD that practices programming problems in a friendly, competitive environment on the popular website https://binarysearch.com/ (rest in peace).
## Why is the Binary Search Gang?
On October 10th, 2022 at approximately 8:40 PM CST, the maintainers of https://binarysearch.com/ (rest in peace) decided to shutdown their services indefinitely. This left hundreds if not thousands of students and professionals that used the platform for technical interview preparation without a similar alternative.

At UTD, the Binary Search Gang is a student interest group made up of students looking to practice programming problems with their friends in a competition-style format. The group exists for the sole purpose of socializing while practicing.
## How is the Binary Search Gang?
For now, we don't know how. But we know it will!
